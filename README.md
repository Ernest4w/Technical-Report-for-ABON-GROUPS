•	25–34 age group has the highest attrition count
•	Male employees show higher attrition than females
Comparison with Initial Findings

8. Data Visualizations & Charts
Charts and Graphs
•	Department-wise attrition pie chart
 
This departmental attrition shows that the organization is losing more people from R&D with over 56.12% as against sales and HR seeing this there is a need to look into what is the root cause of the mass exist in the organization and then to try solve it.
•	Age group employee distribution bar chart
 
The Age group of employee distribution here shows that there are more people within the ages of 24+ to 45. This tells us that there is a productive age range in the organization and if maintained, can produced greater level of expertise in the organization, therefore more effort should be made in keeping this trend as the life line of the organization may be dependent on it. Also, from the chart, there is a possibility that the attrition in the large number of staff of the organization falls within the expertise rank, giving rise to questions of job satisfaction and the health of the working environment.


•	Gender-based attrition comparison
 
From the distribution we are seeing, we find out that Male tends to move from the organization than females giving room to questions like what is the leading cause of this migration and what can be done to stop or atleast causion the effect.
 
From the aggregated distribution above the chart then shows that the largest % of the people leaving the organization falls within the ages of 25 to 34 majority and with 69% of them been male which further brings the question of the work ethics with respect to male and female gender and the demand for their skills in different organization’s, as a result the attrition we are seeing here.
•	Educational field attrition bar chart
 
There are more people in Life Sciences and Medical field leaving, however you should not neglect the fact that the is a growing attrition in the marketing field also because their leaving has a direct impact on the growth of the business and the organsation as a whole.

 
This shows the distribution of Job satisfaction, it is now clear from here why there are attrition in some of the fields this is because most of the job roles the people there are not satisfied with their roles and this is telling the rating and also the action of this job satisfaction is seen in the number of people wanting the leave the organisations. It is clear that over 16.12% of the employee are leaving the organsation which is a very high number and at this rate there is a possible that at every 8 years there will be a totally new and complete set of faces seen in the organization who will then be learning the organizational policy and culture only to leave again, this will give room to the organization spending more on recruitment, training, and others than the need to because of the attrition. Therefore conscious effort is needed to keep them.
